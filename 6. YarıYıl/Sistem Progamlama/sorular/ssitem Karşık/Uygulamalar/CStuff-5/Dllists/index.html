<h2>Doubly Linked Lists</h2>

Doubly linked lists ("dllists") are extremely useful in C, because they let you store
data when you don't know how much data you have.  In C++, they are less useful
because you can call <b>push_back()</b> on vectors.  You don't get vectors
or <b>push_back()</b> in C, so you'll find dllists realy handy.
<p>
With a doubly linked list, each node has two pointers --
one to the next node in the list, and one to the previous
node.  Additionally, each list has an extra node called a "sentinel" node.
This makes life nice in many ways:

<UL>
<LI> You can traverse lists forward and backward.
<LI> You can insert anywhere in a list easily.  This includes
     inserting before a node, after a node, at the front of
     the list, and at the end of the list.
<LI> You can delete nodes very easily.
</UL>

The API for dllists is in 
<a href=dllist.h><b>dllist.h</b></a>.  
It defines a doubly-linked list node:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
typedef struct dllist {
  struct dllist *flink;
  struct dllist *blink;
  Jval val;
} *Dllist;
</pre></td></table></center><p>
<p>
Here are the essential operations supported:

<UL>
<LI> <b>Dllist new_dllist()</b>: Allocates and returns a new doubly linked list.
<LI> <b>free_dllist(Dllist l)</b>: Destroys the list, calling <b>free()</b>
      on all allocated memory in the list.  The list does not have to
      be empty.
<LI> <b>dll_prepend(Dllist l, Jval val)</b>:
       Adds a new node at the beginning of the list.
        This node's value is <b>val</b>.  <b>Dll_prepend()</b> has
        no return value.
<LI> <b>dll_append(Dllist l, Jval val)</b>:
       Adds a new node at the end of the list.
        This node's value is <b>val</b>.  <b>Dll_append()</b> has
        no return value.
<LI> <b>dll_insert_b(Dllist n, Jval val)</b>: 
     Adds a new node to the list 
     right before the specified node.
      This node's value is <b>val</b>.
<LI> <b>dll_insert_a(Dllist n, Jval val)</b>: 
     Adds a new node to the list 
     right after the specified node.
      This node's value is <b>val</b>.
<LI> <b>dll_delete_node(Dllist)</b>: Deletes the given node from the list.
     Don't call this on the sentinel.
<LI> <b>int dll_empty(Dllist l)</b>: Returns whether <b>l</b> is empty.
</UL>
These are also supported, but they are not, in my opinion, essential, so I won't
bother going over them in class.
<UL>
<LI> <b>Dllist dll_nil(Dllist l)</b>: Returns a pointer to the <b>nil</b> 
     (sentinel) node
     for the list.  You can think of <b>nil</b> as a node with no value, that
     begins and ends the list.  Since <b>l</b> points to the sentinel 
     node, <b>dll_nil</b> returns <b>l</b>.  You don't need to call
     <b>dll_nil()</b> to access the sentinel node.  You can just use
     <b>l</b>, although it makes your code more readable if you use
     <b>dll_nil()</b>.
<LI> <b>Dllist dll_first(Dllist l)</b>: Returns a pointer to the first node
     in the list.  
     If the list is empty, this returns the sentinel.  
     As with <b>dll_nil()</b>, you don't need to call <b>dll_first(l)</b> --
     you can just use <b>l->flink</b>.
<LI> <b>Dllist dll_last(Dllist l)</b>: Returns a pointer to the last node
     in the list.  
     If the list is empty, this returns the sentinel.  As
     with <b>dll_nil()</b>, you don't need to call <b>dll_last(l)</b> --
     you can just use <b>l->blink</b>.
<LI> <b>Dllist dll_next(Dllist n)</b>: Returns a pointer to the next node
     in the list after <b>n</b>.  
     If <b>n</b> is the last node on the list,
     then <b>dll_next(n)</b> returns the sentinel.
     As with <b>dll_first()</b>, you don't need to call <b>dll_next(n)</b> --
     you can just use <b>n->flink</b>.
<LI> <b>Dllist dll_prev(Dllist n)</b>: Returns a pointer to the previous node
     in the list before <b>n</b>.  
     If <b>n</b> is the first node on the list,
     then <b>dll_prev(n)</b> returns the sentinel.
     As with <b>dll_last()</b>, you don't need to call <b>dll_prev(n)</b> --
     you can just use <b>n->blink</b>.
<LI> <b>Jval dll_val(Dllist n)</b>: Returns node <b>n</b>'s <b>val</b> 
     field.  Again, you don't need to use this, but sometimes it comes
     in handy.
<LI> <b>int dll_delete_node(Dllist n)</b>: Deletes and frees node <b>n</b>.
</UL>

Finally, there are two macros for traversing <b>dllists</b> forwards
and backwards.  <b>ptr</b> should be a <b>Dllist</b> and <b>list</b>
should be a <b>Dllist</b>:
<pre>
#define dll_traverse(ptr, list) \
  for (ptr = (list)->flink; ptr != (list); ptr = ptr->flink)
#define dll_rtraverse(ptr, list) \
  for (ptr = (list)->blink; ptr != (list); ptr = ptr->blink)
</pre>

These are super-convenient -- I'll show you how to use them below.

<hr>
<h2>The Structure of Dllists</h2>

As mentioned above, the implementation of each <b>dllist</b> is as a circular doubly-linked 
list with a sentinel node.  The code is in
<a href=../Libfdr/src/dllist.c><b>../Libfdr/src/dllist.c</b></a>.
<p>
Once again, the <b>typedef</b> for a <b>dllist</b> node is:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
typedef struct dllist {
  struct dllist *flink;
  struct dllist *blink;
  Jval val;
} *Dllist;
</pre></td></table></center><p>

Note that each node has two pointers -- a forward link (<b>flink</b>) to 
the next node on the list, and a backward link (<b>blink</b>) to the 
previous node on the list. Once you have created a <b>dllist</b>, you'll
keep a pointer to the sentinel node.
<p>
The list is circular in both directions -- the sentinel's <b>flink</b>
points to the first node on the list, and its <b>blink</b> points
to the last node on the list.  The first node's <b>blink</b> points to
the sentinel, as does the last node's <b>flink</b>.
<p>
Some ascii art:  Here's an empty list <b>l</b>, that would be returned from <b>new_dllist()</b>:
<pre>
l ----------------> |-----------|
               /--->| flink ---------\
               | /->| blink -------\ |
               | |  | val = ?   |  | |
               | |  |-----------|  | |
               | |                 | |
               | \-----------------/ |
               |                     |
               \---------------------/
</pre>
And here's that list after calling <b>dll_append(l, new_jval_i(3));</b>:
(or <b>dll_prepend(l, new_jval_i(3))</b> for that matter).
<pre>
l ----------------> |-----------|       |-----------|
               /--->| flink ----------->| flink ---------\
               | /->| blink ----------->| blink -------\ |
               | |  | val = ?   |       | val.i = 3 |  | |
               | |  |-----------|       |-----------|  | |
               | |                                     | |
               | \-------------------------------------/ |
               |                                         |
               \-----------------------------------------/
</pre>
Actually, it makes the drawing cleaner to have the back links go backwards:
<pre>
l ----------------->|-----------|       |-----------|
               /--->| flink ----------->| flink ---------\
               |  /------ blink |<----------- blink |<-\ |
               |  | | val = ?   |       | val.i = 3 |  | |
               |  | |-----------|       |-----------|  | |
               |  |                                    | |
               |  \------------------------------------/ |
               |                                         |
               \-----------------------------------------/
</pre>
Here's that list after calling <b>dll_append(l, new_jval_i(5));</b>:
<pre>
l ---------->|-----------|       |-----------|       |-----------|
        /--->| flink ----------->| flink ----------->| flink ---------\
        |  /------ blink |<----------- blink |<----------- blink |<-\ |
        |  | | val = ?   |       | val.i = 3 |       | val.i = 5 |  | |
        |  | |-----------|       |-----------|       |-----------|  | |
        |  |                                                        | |
        |  \--------------------------------------------------------/ |
        |                                                             |
        \-------------------------------------------------------------/
</pre>

I won't go over more examples with ascii art.  I assume you are getting the hang of it.

<h2>Usage examples</h2>

The first example is one of our standards: reversing standard 
input. This is simple enough to need no explanation.
It's in 
<b><a href=src/dllreverse.c>src/dllreverse.c</a></b>:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
<font color=blue>/* Printing the lines of standard input in reverse order, by appending
   to a dllist, and then printing the dllist backward. */</font>

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include "fields.h"
#include "dllist.h"

int main()
{
  IS is;
  Dllist l;
  Dllist tmp;

  is = new_inputstruct(NULL);
  l = new_dllist();

  while (get_line(is) &gt;= 0) {
    dll_append(l, new_jval_s(strdup(is-&gt;text1)));
  }

  <font color=blue>/* Notice how convenient this macro is! */</font>

  dll_rtraverse(tmp, l) printf("%s", tmp-&gt;val.s);
  return 0;
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

The second example is another standard: printing the last
<b>n</b> lines of standard input.  We do this by reading
standard input into a <b>Dllist</b>, and making sure that
the <b>Dllist</b> always has at most <b>n</b> nodes.  Then
we print it out.  The code is in 
<b><a href=src/dlltail.c>src/dlltail.c</a></b>.

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
<font color=blue>/* This program implements tail using a dllist.  It reads lines onto the dllist until
   it contains the proper number of lines.  Then, each time it reads a line, it appends
   to the dllist and then deletes the first line of the dllist.  At the end, it simply
   prints the dllist. */</font>

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include "fields.h"
#include "dllist.h"

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  IS is;
  int n;
  Dllist l;
  Dllist tmp;

  <font color=blue>/* Error check and read the number of lines to maintain. */</font>

  if (argc != 2) {
    fprintf(stderr, "usage: dlltail n\n");
    exit(1);
  }
  n = atoi(argv[1]);
  if (n &lt; 0) {
    fprintf(stderr, "usage: dlltail n  -- n must be &gt;= 0\n");
    exit(1);
  }

  <font color=blue>/* Create the inputstruct and dllist */</font>

  is = new_inputstruct(NULL);
  l = new_dllist();

  <font color=blue>/* Read each line and append to the dllist. */</font>

  while (get_line(is) &gt;= 0) {
    dll_append(l, new_jval_s(strdup(is-&gt;text1)));

    if (is-&gt;line &gt; n) {          <font color=blue>/* If the dllist is too big, delete the first line on it. */</font>
      free(l-&gt;flink-&gt;val.s);     <font color=blue>/* You have to free it, becuase you called strdup() to create it. */</font>
      dll_delete_node(l-&gt;flink);
    }
  }

  <font color=blue>/* At the end, print the dllist -- again note the convenience of dll_traverse. */</font>

  dll_traverse(tmp, l) printf("%s", tmp-&gt;val.s);
  return 0;
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

A couple of notes about this program.  First, you have to call <b>strdup()</b> to copy
the string that you have read from standard input.  Otherwise, <b>get_line()</b> will 
overwrite the string, and all of your lines will be the same (we've gone over this 
concept multiple times, but I like to keep hammering the point home).
<p>
Second, when you call <b>dll_delete_node()</b> it removes the node from the list and
frees the node.  However, if the <b>val</b> field points to data that has been allocated
with <b>malloc()</b>, then that data is not freed automatically.  That is because the
<b>dllist</b> library has no idea what the data is.  Perhaps you want it freed, or 
perhaps you don't, because it is on mutiple data structures. 
<p>
In this program, you most definitely want to free the data -- suppose you read a file
that has 10G worth of text and you simply want to read the last 10 lines -- if you 
don't free the data when you delete a node, you'll burn 10G of memory.
If you do free the data, then you only store 10 lines in memory at a time.
<p>
<hr>
<h2>A Last Example</h2>

The following assignment is from CS202, in C++:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td>
<h3>COS: Columns of strings and doubles</h3>

You're going to hate this program.  Sorry.  You are going to write <b>cos.cpp</b>.  This reads words
from standard input and partitions them into doubles and non-doubles.  On line 1, it will
print the first non-double and the first double.  On line 2, it will print the second non-double
and the second double.  And so on.  The format of each line should be:
<p>
<UL>
<LI> The non-double, padded to 30 characters and left justified.
<LI> A space.
<LI> The double, padded to 20 characters, right justified with four digits after the
decimal point.
</UL>
<p>
Thus, each line will be 51 characters.  If there are the same number of doubles and non-doubles,
then life is easy.  However, if there are more doubles than non-doubles, you simply print 
30 spaces when you get to the lines that have no non-doubles.  If there are more non-doubles than
doubles, then you simply print 20 spaces where the double would go.
<p>
You may assume that the words in standard input are 30 characters or less.
<p>

UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

In case you're wondering, "cat -e" prints standard input on standard output
and puts a '$' at the end of the line.
It's nice to be able to see spaces at the end of a line.
</td></table></center><p>

The solution is to use two Dllists -- one for doubles and one for strings.  
When you read stdin, you use <b>sscanf()</b> to determine if a word is a double,
and if it is, you put it on the double lists.  Otherwise, you call <b>strdup()</b>
and put the string on the string lists.  Then you print out in three phases.
In the first, you print all the lines which have both doubles and strings.  When
you're done with that loop, you may have doubles or strings leftover.  The remaining
two loops handle each case.  The code is in
<b><a href=src/cos.c>src/cos.c</a></b>:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
<font color=blue>/* This program reads words and puts each word onto one of two lists.  If the word is
   a double, it puts it on one list.  If it's not, it puts it on the other list.  It
   then prints the two lists in two columns, formatted.  Please see the lecture notes
   for a precise definition of the format. */</font>

<h3>Implementation Details</h3>

<font color=darkred>I don't go over this in class, because it should be review from 
CS202.  However, I keep it in the lecture notes in case you want some review on 
implementing doubly-linked lists.  I haven't touched these notes since 1998, so they
may feature some old-school C.  Sorry.</font>
<p>
Many of the procedure implementations are trivial procedures or macros:
<pre>
<hr> 
Dllist new_dllist()
{
  Dllist d;

  d = (Dllist) malloc (sizeof(struct dllist));
  d->flink = d;
  d->blink = d;
  return d;
}
<hr>
dll_empty(Dllist l)
{
  return (l->flink == l);
}

<hr>
free_dllist(Dllist l)
{
  while (!dll_empty(l)) {
    dll_delete_node(dll_first(l));
  }
  free(l);
}
<hr>

#define dll_first(d) ((d)->flink)
#define dll_next(d) ((d)->flink)
#define dll_last(d) ((d)->blink)
#define dll_prev(d) ((d)->blink)
#define dll_nil(d) (d)

<hr>
</pre>
The only subtle pieces of code are <b>dll_insert_b()</b> and 
<b>dll_delete_node</b>.  With <b>dll_insert_b(n, v)</b> we
<b>malloc()</b> a new node, set its value to <b>v</b>, and then
link it into the list right before <b>n</b>.  This means that
we set the new node's <b>flink</b> field to <b>n</b>, and its
<b>blink</b> field to <b>n->blink</b>.  Then we set <b>n->blink</b>
to the new node, and the old <b>n->blink</b>'s <b>flink</b> field
to  the new node.  Here's the code:
<pre>
dll_insert_b(Dllist node, Jval v)       /* Inserts before a given node */
{
  Dllist new;

  new = (Dllist) malloc (sizeof(struct dllist));
  new->val = v;

  new->flink = node;
  new->blink = node->blink;
  new->flink->blink = new;
  new->blink->flink = new;

Once we have <b>dll_insert_b()</b> the other three list insertion 
routines are simply calls to <b>dll_insert_b()</b>:
<pre>
dll_insert_a(Dllist n, Jval val)        /* Inserts after a given node */
{
  dll_insert_b(n->flink, val);
} 

dll_append(Dllist l, Jval val)     /* Inserts at the end of the list */
{ 
  dll_insert_b(l, val);
}

dll_prepend(Dllist l, Jval val)    /* Inserts at the beginning of the list */
{ 
  dll_insert_b(l->flink, val);
} 
</pre>

Deletion is pretty easy too.  First you must remove the node <b>n</b>'s
from the list by setting <b>n->flink->blink</b> to <b>n->blink</b>
and by setting <b>n->blink->flink</b> to <b>n->flink</b>.  Then
you free <b>n</b>:
<pre>
dll_delete_node(Dllist node)            /* Deletes an arbitrary iterm */
{
  node->flink->blink = node->blink;
  node->blink->flink = node->flink;
  free(node);
}
</pre>
