*** USE scripts/pga-convert.sh to convert the "PAST_RESULTS" link on pgatour.com to the right
    format ***

- Go over the header:
   - Class
   - Inserts - Converts to Jval.
   - Finds
   - Find_gte
   - Traversals

- Write strsort   - sort stdin
        strrsort  - sort stdin reverse (rtraverse)
        strrsort  - sort stdin reverse (custom comparison function)
        strusort  - cull duplicates (use find)
        strisort  - ignore case by creating a different key
        nsort     - use insert_int on atoi()
        nsort2    - use general to do a secondary sort lexicographically
        nsort3    - two level tree.

ni_sort -- look at data/input-nn.txt -- create person struct and print sorted by
           score and then name.  Output = name "%-40s" and score "%2d"

           First try -- create sorting key.

           Second try -- create comparison function.

           Third try -- two-level tree.

Talk briefly about the golf program but don't worry about it -- just promote it in the lecture
     notes.
