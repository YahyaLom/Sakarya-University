- Go over compilation.  Again.
- Go over the header file, and the parts that you care about.
- Write printwords.c (every word on every line with line number.)
- Malloc is only called during new_inputstruct().

     The most common mistake that students make with the fields library, 
     and with fgets() in general, is not to make a copy when they need a copy.

- Write tail10-bad.  Print the pointers
- Fix with strdup.  Niavely.   Show the memory leak.
- Show how to demonstrate the memory leak with an awk script and top.
- Fix the memory leak.

- (Talk about pipe_inputstruct, and tailany if you want some more practice with malloc).
