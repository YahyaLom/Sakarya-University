- Explain a union and simply show jval.h.
- Explain the only things you'll use.
- Go over src/simple_jval.c -- Easier than writing it.
- Go over "constructor" functions.  Go over src/jval_ex2.c - Again, easier than writing it.
- Talk about abuse.
- "Accessor functions" -- not really important, but go over.
