<h2>The Jval type</h2>

In 
<a href=http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/include/jval.h><b>jval.h</b></a>, 
I define a type called a <b>Jval</b>.  This is a big union:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
typedef union {
    int i;
    long l;
    float f;
    double d;
    void *v;
    char *s;
    char c;
    unsigned char uc;
    short sh;
    unsigned short ush;
    unsigned int ui;
    int iarray[2];
    float farray[2];
    char carray[8];
    unsigned char ucarray[8];
  } Jval;  
</pre></td></table></center><p>

In case you don't know, a union is like a struct, except you can only use one of the fields at a time.
In other words, if you have a <b>Jval</b> named <b>jv</b>, then you may set and use 
<b>jv.i</b> as an integer, and
<b>jv.d</b> as a double, but not both at the same time.
<p>
I've made use of <b>Jval</b>'s when I write generic data structures
such as lists, and trees.  For the purposes of this class, don't worry
about most of the fields in the union.  The only important ones are:
<pre>
    int i;
    float f;
    double d;
    void *v;
    char *s;
    char c;
</pre>
The nice thing about a <b>Jval</b> is that you can hold one piece of 
data in a <b>Jval</b>, regardless of what the type of that piece of
data is.  Moreover, the <b>Jval</b> will always be 8 bytes.
<p>
Here's a very simple example, which is pretty unmotivated, except that it
demonstrates the union
(<b><a href=src/simple_jval.c>src/simple_jval.c</a></b>):

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
<font color=blue>/* This program shows the very simple use of a jval. */</font>

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include "jval.h"

int main()
{
  Jval jv;

  <font color=blue>/* Set and use as an integer. */</font>

  jv.i = 10;
  printf("Using the jval as an integer: %d\n", jv.i);

  <font color=blue>/* Set and use as a double. */</font>

  jv.d = 5.6;
  printf("Using the jval as a double: %.2lf\n", jv.d);

  <font color=blue>/* Set and use as a char *. */</font>

  jv.s = "Fred";
  printf("Using the jval as a char *: %s\n", jv.s);

  <font color=blue>/* Since I've set it as a (char *), I shouldn't use it as a double. */</font>

  printf("If I now print the jval as a double, I get garbage: %lg\n", jv.d);
  return 0;
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

Pay attention to that last <b>printf()</b> -- you should only use a jval using the 
type that you used when you set its value.  That last <b>printf()</b> is treating the 8
bytes that were set to be a pointer as a double, and accordingly you get a really
weird number:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>bin/simple_jval</b></font>
Using the jval as an integer: 10
Using the jval as a double: 5.60
Using the jval as a char *: Fred
If I now print the jval as a double, I get garbage: 2.13063e-314
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

<h2>Constructor functions</h2>

You can of course, create and use a <b>Jval</b> by simply declaring and 
using it.  For example:
<pre>
  Jval j;
  
  j.i = 4;
</pre>
You can freely pass <b>Jval</b>'s to and from procedure calls.  A <b>Jval</b>
can be the return value of a procedure call.
<p>
<b>Jval.h</b> defines a whole bunch of prototypes for "constructor
functions":
<pre>
extern Jval new_jval_i(int);
extern Jval new_jval_f(float);
extern Jval new_jval_d(double);
extern Jval new_jval_v(void *);
extern Jval new_jval_s(char *);
</pre>
These return <b>Jval</b>'s to you when you give them arguments
of a specific type.  For example, if you want to initialize a <b>Jval</b>
so that it is in integer whose value is 4, you can do it as shown above, 
or you can do:
<pre>
  Jval j;

  j = new_jval_i(4);
</pre>
Now <b>j.i</b> will be the integer 4.  This is convenient when you are using
a procedure that takes a <b>Jval</b> as a parameter, because you can call the
procedure and never actually declare the <b>Jval</b>.  
Here's an example, in 
<b><a href=src/jval_ex2.c>src/jval_ex2.c</a></b>:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
<font color=blue>/* A program that demonstrates the "constructor" functions, and how they help
   when you are using a procedure that takes a jval as a parameter. */</font>

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include "fields.h"
#include "jval.h"

<font color=blue>/* Print a jval as an integer, double or string. */</font>

void print_jval(Jval jv, char how)
{
  switch (how) {
    case 'i': printf("%d\n", jv.i); break;
    case 'd': printf("%lg\n", jv.d); break;
    case 's': printf("%s\n", jv.s); break;
    default: fprintf(stderr, "Bad 'how' variable in print_jval: %c\n", how);
             exit(1);
  }
}

<font color=blue>/* Call print_jval.  Note that I never have to declare a jval, because I'm using the constructors. */</font>
int main()
{
  print_jval(new_jval_i(10), 'i');
  print_jval(new_jval_d(5.6), 'd');
  print_jval(new_jval_s("Fred"), 's');
  return 0;
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

<h2>Abusing Jval's</h2>

The purpose of the <b>Jval</b> type is to make general purpose data
structures such as dllists and red-black trees as flexible
and efficient as possible.  You
should not use <b>Jval</b>'s in your code for any other reason.
<p>
Specifically, you are not to say, use a <b>Jval</b> instead of an 
<b>int</b> in your code just because it works.  That makes your code
unreadable, and unreadability is majorly bad.  Here is an example
of bad code to average all of the integers on standard input
(<b><a href=src/badavg.c>src/badavg.c</a></b>):

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
<font color=blue>/* A program that abuses jvals.  It averages integers on standard input. */</font>

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include "jval.h"

int main()
{
  Jval total;      <font color=blue>/* You'll note, no types other than Jvals. */</font>
  Jval j;
  Jval n;

  n.i = 0;         <font color=blue>/* n and j are always treated as ints.  They should be ints. */</font>
  total.i = 0;     <font color=blue>/* Total starts as an int */</font>
  
  while (scanf("%d", &(j.i)) == 1) {
    total.i += j.i;
    n.i++;
  }

  <font color=blue>/* And then total is used as a double.  You should simply use a double.... */</font>

  total.d = ((double) total.i) / ((double) n.i);
  printf("Average = %lf\n", total.d);
  return 0;
}

</pre></td></table></center><p>

Yes, it works, and yes, it's a cute way to use <b>total</b> as both an
<b>int</b> and a <b>double</b>.  But it is revolting -- every use of
<b>Jval</b>'s is bad, and if you use them in ways like these, you should be
punished.  
<p>
(In case you care, the code should look as in 
<b><a href=src/goodavg.c>src/goodavg.c</a></b>):

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
<font color=blue>/* The proper version of this program just uses doubles for total and n.  It's not
   like there are ints that can't be stored in a double, and you're using floating
   point division, so you need the doubles. */</font>

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

int main()
{
  double total;
  double n;
  int j;

  n = 0;
  total = 0;
  
  while (scanf("%d", &j) == 1) {
    total += j;
    n++;
  }

  if (n == 0) exit(1);
  printf("Average = %lf\n", total/n);

  return 0;
}

</pre></td></table></center><p>

<h2>Accessor functions</h2>

I have put accessor functions into <b>jval.h</b>/<b>jval.c</b>.  An
accessor function simply lets you get the desired value out of a 
<b>Jval</b> by calling a function rather than accessing the field.
Why would you want to do this?  Well, like the constructor functions,
it makes life easier in certain circumstances (when you are using 
a <b>Jval</b> that is returned from a procedure.  The accessor functions
are:
<pre>
extern int    jval_i(Jval);
extern long   jval_l(Jval);
extern float  jval_f(Jval);
extern double jval_d(Jval);
extern void  *jval_v(Jval);
extern char  *jval_s(Jval);
extern char   jval_c(Jval);
...
</pre>
So, for example, calling <b>jval_i(j)</b> is the same as using <b>j.i</b>.
