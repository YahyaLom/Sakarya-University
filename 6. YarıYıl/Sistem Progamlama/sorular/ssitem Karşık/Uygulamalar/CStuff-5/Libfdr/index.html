With C, you lose the C++ standard template library, which is a major drag.
To help you, I have a 20+ year old library of helper programs, which I 
call "Libfdr".  There are four modules that compose libdr:
<UL>
<LI> <a href=../Fields>Fields</a> - a library to simplify input processing
<LI> <a href=../Jval>Jvals</a> - a generic data type
<LI> <a href=../Dllists>Dllists</a> - a library for doubly-linked lists
<LI> <a href=../JRB>Red-Black Trees</a> - a library for red-black trees 
</UL>

Each of these has a set of lecture notes associated with them.  You 
should read each of these to familiarize yourself with them.  CS360 Lab 2
makes you use all of them.

<h2>Obtaining the Source Code</h2>

The source code is here in this directory, so if you have pulled the bitbucket
repo, then you have the source code.   Type <b>make</b> to make the precompiled
library <b>libfdr.a</b>.
<hr>
<h2>On the University of Tennessee EECS Machines</h2>

For the purposes of CS360, I have put the header files into the directory
<b>/home/jplank/cs360/include</b>, and a compiled library into 
<b>/home/jplank/cs360/objs</b>.  That way, you don't have to have copies
of the programs sprinkled all over your lab directories.  Obviously, if
you are on a non-UT machine, you'll need to design out a way to compile
and link the programs with your labs.  I would prefer that you put them
into a separate directory, though, so you can simply use mine when you are
on the EECS machines.

<h3>Compilation and Linking</h3>

To compile your code, you need to use the complier flag
<b>-I/home/jplank/cs360/include</b>.  For example, if you 
have included ``fields.h'' and ``dllist.h'' in your program <b>lab1.c</b>,
then your first compilation step is:
<pre>
gcc -g -I/home/jplank/cs360/include -c lab1.c
</pre>
That will make <b>lab1.o</b>.  Now, when you go to link <b>lab1.o</b> into
an executable, you need to link with 
<b>/home/jplank/cs360/objs/libfdr.a</b>:
<pre>
gcc -g -o lab1 lab1.o /home/jplank/cs360/objs/libfdr.a
</pre>
As always, you can do all of this in a makefile to make your life easier.
We will provide makefiles for the first few labs.  After that, you'll
probably be on your own.
