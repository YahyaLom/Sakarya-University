Nothing exciting -- just introduce and talk about compilation.
Prepare them for warnings.

Typically, I can do compilation, fields, jvals and dllists in one lecture,
and JRB's in another.  

- Sometimes, I don't go over badavg/goodavg in detail (I did show badavg).
- Sometimes, I don't go over cos.c in dllist.

I did the clicker question on day 1 when I was done with jvals.
